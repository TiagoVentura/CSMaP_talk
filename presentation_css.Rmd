- Users' friendship networks are heterogeneous outside of politics .red[(Bakshy et al. 2012; Barbéra  et  al.,  2015;  Wojcieszak  and  Mutz, 2009)]

- Users’ digital media diets are balanced, and strongly influenced by big reputable outlets .red[(Guess 2021)]

- Exposure to counter-attitudinal and uncivil content increases  affective polarization .red[(Bail et al., 2018, Banks et al., 2021; Suhay et al., 2018)]

**Strong correlation between ideology and attention:**

- More partisan users share more content

- Partisan content will be over-represented.

- Social media bubbles will emerge from activation, even if networks are heterogenous.

## Modeling Social Media Activation with Image-Based Conjoint Experiments

### .red[*Observational data cannot fully separate activation from sorting.]*

**Solution**: Image-Based Conjoint Experiments

**Advantages**:

- Flexible

- Equal probability for all the frames

- High ecological validity

**Outcomes**: Which message would you share? Which message are your friends more likely to share?

#### How to model network dependency with Big Data?

- Most network models are to computationally intensive for large networks.

- Solution: Model Locally + Weighted by Closest Paths

- Extension of Geographically Weighted Regression Model

- Use Cross-Validation to Determine Optimal Number of Paths

- Allows to model heterogeneity on networks and easy to paralelize.

.panel[.panel-name[Field Experiment]


We conducted a large scale ''field" experiment that assigns would-be debate viewers to watch on different platforms the October 2019 Democratic Debate.

Two-Wave On-line Survey in September 2019 through MTurk (following Gross, Porter and Wood, 2019). 

**Three main experimental conditions**

- Control (standard NBC broadcast)
- Expert chat (538 website)
- Streaming chat (Facebook)

We then surveyed the respondents after the debate and measured the effects of streaming chats. 
]

.panel[.panel-name[Observational Setup]

#### Text Analysis

To complement our analysis, we built automatic scrapper (Selenium) to collect comments on facebook pages

- One Hundred Thousand Comments  from Facebook pages.

- Several Expert Chats

- Performed Dictionary Methods Sentiment Analysis. 

- Deep Learning Models to identify toxicity. 


]

.panel[.panel-name[Next Steps]

#### Grant under review to: 

- Deploy a similar experiment in Brazil, during the Presidential Election

- Combine the field experiments with collection of web-browsing data

- Measure behavioral mechanisms with a laboratory experiment

**Main Findings**:

- Creates worse viewing experience.

- May disproportionately negatively affect certain candidates subject to toxic, negative comments.

- May distort inferences about candidate viability.

**Next Steps**:

- More research on the mechanism (laboraty experiments).

- More comparative evidence (Does it replicate to other plataforms or other countries?). 

- More descriptive evidence about these news technologies.

## Statistical Model

The estimation of the utility function for sharing uses a multilevel overdispersed poisson model. 

.center[
$y_{ij} \sim \mbox{Po}(\mu_i)$

$\mu_i = \exp(\alpha_{i[q]}\left(x_{i}-L_{j}\right)^2 + A_{[q]} + R_{[j]} + \gamma_{[i]})$
]

Where:

* $y_{i}$ = Number of links embedded by user x media

* $\alpha_{q}$ = Random Slope by quantile 

* $A_{q}$ = Random intercept by quantile

* $R_{j}$ = Random intercept by media outlet 

* $\gamma_{[i]}$ = Overdispersion parameter
